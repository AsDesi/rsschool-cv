## About myself.

I have a lot of experience in the field of design.
At first I worked in the printing industry.
Then I started working in a company with programmers, where my duty was to develop website design.
Gradually, I became interested in creating web sites through code.
Since then, I have taken several online courses on this topic.
I also have several independent projects, but so far made on Webflow and WordPress.
In them, I partially used my new skills in HTML, CSS and Java Script.

I appreciate humor and responsibility.
I am a good team player.
I have excellent teaching skills (I have a professional teaching education), and on the other hand I am a fast learner.
I love to travel, play sports and dance.
